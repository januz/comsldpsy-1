This research compendium comprises all the input and output files as well as the R code needed to reproduce our `r pkgenv$product`:

> `r pkgenv$authors` (`r pkgenv$year`). *`r pkgenv$title`*. `r pkgenv$journal` `r pkgenv$doi_published`

The compendium uses the R package `drake` to define a reproducible processing pipeline linking inputs to outputs/targets similar to `GNU make` (for more information on the `drake` package, see [here](https://ropensci.github.io/drake/)). This vignette describes how to reproduce the analysis, check the analysis pipeline, and inspect analysis steps and outputs.

## Copy the analysis directory structure

```{r}
library(comsldpsy)
copy_analysis()
```

After attaching the package, executing the function `copy_analysis()` copies the analysis directory structure  to the current working directory (or an explicitely specified directory). The directory should now contain the following files:

```
.
└── .drake
    └── [...]
└── analysis
    ├── data
    │   └── data_orig.rds             # raw data
    ├── manuscript
    │   └── manuscript.docx           # manuscript as submitted
    └── templates
        └── manuscript_template.docx  # manuscript template
```

These files represent all input files required to reproduce the analysis as well as all output files generated in the process. The function further copies a `.drake` directory to the same directory. This hidden directory stores information about the consistency of the analysis pipeline and all intermediate outputs.

## Reproduce the analysis

Reproducing the analysis can be done in a two-step procedure:

1. Executing the function `reproduce_analysis()` copies the analysis directory structure (if it isn't already present) and then runs `drake::make()`. The output provides evidence of reproducibility without actually re-running the analysis. If the analysis is reproducible, the output should look like this:

    ```{r}
    reproduce_analysis()
    ```

2. To independently re-create the analysis results on ones own computer, one can run `reproduce_analysis()` with the option `re_run = TRUE`. This will delete the copied `.drake` folder and re-run the entire analysis from scratch, re-creating all relevant intermediate steps and outputs.

    ```{r,eval=FALSE}
    reproduce_analysis(re_run = TRUE)
    #> Reproducing analysis included in package 'comsldpsy':
    #> Analysis directory structure is already in place.
    #> Re-running analysis from scratch...
    #> target data_raw
    #> target manuscript_in
    #> target data_transformed
    #> target data_filtered
    #> [...]
    #> target manuscript_text
    #> target manuscript_tables
    #> target manuscript_figures
    #> target manuscript_out
    ```
    
## Explore the analysis pipeline and results

Executing `get_plan()` returns the underlying `drake` plan used to run the analysis. The returned data frame lists all intermediate results (targets), the commands executed to create them, and the dependencies between them.

```{r}
plan <- get_plan()
plan
```

The `drake` package provides  [several ways](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/vis.html) to visualize the analysis pipeline, e.g.

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
config <- drake_config(plan)
vis_drake_graph(config)
```

Furthermore, `drake` provides functions for viewing individual targets (`drake::readd()`) or load them into the current environment (`drake::loadd()`).

For example, to view the cleaned data set, use:

```{r}
readd(data_filtered)
```

to view the results of the poisson regression model, use:

```{r}
readd(df_poisson)
```

or, to view one of the figures included in the `r pkgenv$product`, use:

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
readd(figure_3)
```

## Cleaning up

Executing `delete_analysis()` removes the `analysis` and `.drake` directories from the working directory (or an explicitely specified directory).

```{r}
delete_analysis()
```
